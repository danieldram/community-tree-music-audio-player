# New Audio Player Idea for Community Tree Music
Current phase of the project, still a WIP but has base functionality for further development requirements.

## How To Use
Copy the static assets in the /css and /js folder and serve them through your server as you would normally with any other JS/CSS
Then add this line of code to where you would like the audio player to be seen

```
<div id="audio-player"
class="col-md-12"
data-file="music.mp3"
data-trackname="Hate This Part"
data-artist="Autumn Reign"
data-artwork="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f0/eb/6b/f0eb6ba9d6f3ca4e8b996495c134de12.jpg">


</div>


```
